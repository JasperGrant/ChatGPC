# ChatGPC: A ChatGPT in C proof of concept
Created mostly to prove knowledge of Curl

## Running Tests:
1. Insert your API key into the line of ChatGPC.h marked "YOUR API KEY HERE" (Keep the "")
2. Specify your output file with the OUTPUT_FILE macro (Keep the "")
3. Run tests to see ChatGPC tell you something cool in your output file!

## In the future I want to add:
- Better tests.
- Useful return type to ask_GPT.
- Multiple output formats.
- Sanitized inputs.
- Better control of request config options such as model and role.
